<h2>Wouldn't you like to know...</h2>
<article>To start my names Amanda Winitzer. I'm currently a graphic design student attending Massachusetts College of Art and Design or just MassArt for short. I enjoy working in all different mediums of art. Most of the time I'm bouncing between different graphic design programs working on screen but I also enjoy illustration, photography, sculpture, and fibers as well. I constantly need to be doing or learning something new or else I get bored easily. I'm better off multi-tasking instead of trying to just focus on one project at a time.</article>
